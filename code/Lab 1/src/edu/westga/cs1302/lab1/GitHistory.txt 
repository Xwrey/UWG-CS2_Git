    Separate bill formatting from model
    
    Moved text generation logic from the Bill class to a new BillFormatter
    class to improve separation of concerns. The model should not be
    responsible for view-related formatting.
    
    - Removed getText() from Bill.java and added getItems().
    - Created new BillTextGen class in the view package.
    - Placed original text generation logic in BillFormatter.getText().
